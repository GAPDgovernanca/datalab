## SSH Key Setup on Linux

1. **Generate a new SSH key**:

    ```sh
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "gapd.data.lab@gmail.com"
    ```

    If you're using a legacy system that doesn't support the Ed25519 algorithm, use:

    ```sh
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "gapd.data.lab@gmail.com"
    ```

2. **Add your SSH key to the ssh-agent**:

    ```sh
    eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    ```

    If you used RSA:

    ```sh
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    ```

3. **Add the SSH key to your GitHub account**:

    Copy the SSH key to your clipboard:

    ```sh
    cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
    ```

    If you used RSA:

    ```sh
    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    ```

    Then, go to GitHub and add the key to your account:
    - Go to **Settings** > **SSH and GPG keys** > **New SSH key**
    - Paste the key and save it

4. **Test your SSH connection**:

    ```sh
    ssh -T git@github.com
    ```

    You should see a message like:

    ```sh
    Hi gapd.data.lab! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
    ```

5. **Push your changes again**:

    ```sh
    git push origin master
    ```

## SSH Key Setup on Windows

1. **Open Git Bash**: Open Git Bash on your Windows system.

2. **Generate a new SSH key**:

    ```sh
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "gapd.data.lab@gmail.com"
    ```

    If you're using a legacy system that doesn't support the Ed25519 algorithm, use:

    ```sh
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "gapd.data.lab@gmail.com"
    ```

3. **Add your SSH key to the ssh-agent**:

    ```sh
    eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    ssh-add /c/Users/YourUsername/.ssh/id_ed25519
    ```

    If you used RSA:

    ```sh
    ssh-add /c/Users/YourUsername/.ssh/id_rsa
    ```

4. **Add the SSH key to your GitHub account**:

    Copy the SSH key to your clipboard:

    ```sh
    cat /c/Users/YourUsername/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
    ```

    If you used RSA:

    ```sh
    cat /c/Users/YourUsername/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    ```

5. **Test your SSH connection**:

    ```sh
    ssh -T git@github.com
    ```

    You should see a message like:

    ```sh
    Hi gapd.data.lab! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
    ```

6. **Configure VSCode to use SSH**:

    Open VSCode and ensure that it uses the correct SSH key by configuring the SSH settings if necessary.
