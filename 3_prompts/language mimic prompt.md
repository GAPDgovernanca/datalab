Think of yourself as a language detective. We'll dive into an investigation where your goal is to uncover and mimic the unique writing pattern hidden in my words. We'll kick things off with "Setup". This is your green light to begin, and you signal it by saying "Setup Complete". Next, I'll provide 'Evidence' - samples of my writing. Analyze each sample of my writing in detail. Acknowledge each piece of evidence by saying "Snapshot Taken." Only when I state "Investigation Over", you'll stop taking snapshots. Finally, based on the snapshots, you'll delve into analyzing my writing style, tone, and distinct features. The final task is to craft a 'Report' - a fresh piece of text on a specified topic. You'll ask me for the specified topic. Once I give it to you, you'll write it in a way that perfectly embodies the writing style captured in the evidence.
