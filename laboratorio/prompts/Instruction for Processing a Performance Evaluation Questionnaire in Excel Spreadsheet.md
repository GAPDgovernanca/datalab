# Instruction for Processing a Performance Evaluation Questionnaire in CSV File

### Objective

This instruction describes how to read and process a CSV file containing a performance evaluation questionnaire with objective questions in a Likert scale and subjective questions with descriptive answers. The goal is to ensure the correct interpretation of the data for effective subsequent analysis, using appropriate data manipulation and conversion tools.

### Process Steps

1. **Reading the CSV File**:
   
   - Use the `pandas` library to load the CSV file. Use `pd.read_csv()` to access the file and load the data:
     
     ```python
     df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
     ```

2. **Identifying and Inspecting Columns**:
   
   - List and display the column names of the DataFrame to ensure the correct identification of the questions before processing:
     
     ```python
     columns = df.columns
     ```

3. **Data Identification and Cleaning**:
   
   - Check for missing or null values and, if necessary, apply the `df.fillna()` method to fill missing data with `None` to ensure empty cells are correctly identified for later handling:
     
     ```python
     df.fillna(None, inplace=True)
     ```
   - Ensure columns containing dates are in the correct format using `pd.to_datetime()`.

4. **Likert Scale Data Conversion**:
   
   - For objective (Likert) questions, map textual responses to numerical values. Use a mapping dictionary to translate the responses according to the correct scale (e.g., "Happens often", "Never happens") into numbers from 1 to 5:
     
     ```python
     likert_map = {
         'Never happens': 1,
         'Almost never happens': 2,
         'Occurs occasionally': 3,
         'Happens often': 4,
         'Happens all the time': 5,
         'I don't know': None
     }
     df['objective_column'] = df['objective_column'].map(likert_map)
     ```

5. **Organizing into Sections**:
   
   - The questionnaire is divided into 6 sections, with 12 questions each (10 objective and 2 subjective):
     
     - **PEOPLE DEVELOPMENT SECTION**
     - **TEAMWORK SECTION**
     - **PLANNING AND ORGANIZATION SECTION**
     - **RESULTS ORIENTATION SECTION**
     - **TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE SECTION**
     - **RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION SECTION**
   
   - Identify and map the questions based on the column text patterns, organizing them into objective and subjective questions. Example:
     
     ```python
     sections = {
         'People Development': {
             'Objective': [question1, question2, ...],
             'Subjective': [question11, question12]
         }
     }
     ```

6. **Mapping Verification and Validation**:
   
   - Display a summary of the questions in a section to ensure the questions are organized correctly:
     
     ```python
     print(sections['People Development'])
     ```

7. **Final Conversion and Insights Extraction**:
   
   - Ensure the data is properly organized to allow both quantitative (Likert) and qualitative (descriptive) analysis.
   - Use text processing techniques if necessary to analyze the subjective responses.

### Enhanced Python Code Example

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('path_to_file.csv')

# List columns
columns = df.columns

# Handle missing data with None to maintain empty cells
df.fillna(None, inplace=True)

# Map Likert responses
likert_map = {
    'Never happens': 1,
    'Almost never happens': 2,
    'Occurs occasionally': 3,
    'Happens often': 4,
    'Happens all the time': 5,
    'I don't know': None
}
df['likert_column'] = df['likert_column'].map(likert_map)

# Mapping sections
sections = {
    'People Development': {
        'Objective': df[['column1', 'column2', ...]],
        'Subjective': df[['subj_column1', 'subj_column2']]
    },
    # Other sections
}

# Validation
print(sections['People Development'])
```

### Final Considerations

This procedure provides a structured approach to processing data in a performance evaluation questionnaire, ensuring that all steps—from reading and cleaning the data to organizing the questions by section—are performed accurately, providing a reliable basis for quantitative and qualitative analysis of the results.
