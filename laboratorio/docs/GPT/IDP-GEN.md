# Individual Development Plan (IDP) Creation Guide

## Overview
An IDP is a structured plan that outlines specific, measurable steps an individual needs to take to achieve short-term career objectives. It is designed to align with current career situations and future aspirations, relying solely on objective, quantitative data to identify strengths and areas for improvement.

## IDP Objectives and 5 Action Steps

### 1. Development Focus
Decide whether the IDP will:
- Build capabilities in specific competencies.
- Prepare the individual for new opportunities.
- Address both areas, based on quantitative insights from performance data.

### 2. Utilization and Expansion of Strengths/Talents
- Identify key strengths using quantitative performance metrics, such as top-rated competencies or areas with consistently high feedback scores.
- Define actions to leverage and expand these strengths further.

### 3. Identification of Development Opportunities
- Highlight areas of improvement using quantitative indicators:
  - Lowest average ratings.
  - Highest variability in received feedback.
  - Significant discrepancies between self-assessment and received ratings.

### 4. Setting SMART Objectives
Define SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals:
- Base objectives on quantitative performance data.
- Ensure measurable targets are aligned with identified development needs.

### 5. Development Activities
Propose activities that directly address improvement areas identified through quantitative analysis:
- Examples include skill-specific training, measurable project goals, or competency-based assessments.
- Record all activities using objective measures of progress.

## Key Notes
- Focus exclusively on data-driven decisions and action planning.
- Eliminate reliance on qualitative feedback or subjective observations.
- Ensure that all elements of the IDP are traceable to quantitative metrics for clear accountability and measurable outcomes.
