# 6-Step Step-by-Step Guide
The Integrated Multidimensional Feedback Analysis technique integrates quantitative and qualitative feedback from multiple sources to assess performance and competencies. Follow these steps to use the technique:
## Step 1: Data Collection
- Gather quantitative data from performance reviews (presented on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 to 5), including self-assessment, peer, subordinate, and manager feedback.
- Collect qualitative feedback on each competency assessed, including comments, specific examples, and suggestions.
## Step 2: Quantitative Analysis
1. **Prepare and Validate Data:**
   - **Import Data:** Begin by importing the assessment data into a structured DataFrame, ensuring all values are correctly represented and aligned with their respective questions and raters.
   - **Validate Data:** Verify the successful importation of data, checking for consistency, proper alignment, and the handling of null or missing values.
2. **Calculate Means for Each Item:**
   - Separate responses into two groups:
     - **Self-assessment ratings:** Ratings provided by the individual being evaluated.
     - **Received ratings:** Ratings provided by subordinates, peers, or other raters.
   - For each question:
     - Exclude null or missing values from the calculations.
     - Calculate the mean for the received ratings only, ensuring valid responses are included in the numerator and denominator.
3. **Compare Self-Assessment vs. Received Ratings:**
   - For each question, directly compare the self-assessment rating to the mean of the received ratings.
   - Identify and record discrepancies (differences) between the two values.
   - Highlight questions where discrepancies exceed a predefined threshold (e.g., ±1.0 point), as these indicate significant misalignment in perceptions.
4. **Calculate Overall Averages:**
   - Compute the overall average for:
     - **Self-assessment:** Average of all self-assessment ratings across all questions.
     - **Received ratings:** Average of the question-level means for received ratings.
5. **Identify Top and Bottom Competencies:**
   - Rank questions by their average received ratings.
   - Highlight the top 3 competencies (highest averages).
   - Highlight the bottom 3 competencies (lowest averages).
6. **Analyze Variations Among Received Ratings:**
   - Evaluate the range of ratings (minimum to maximum) for each question within the received ratings group.
   - Identify questions with high variability, which may indicate inconsistent perceptions among raters.
## Step 3: Qualitative Analysis
- Analyze qualitative comments to identify common themes, highlighted strengths, and areas for development.
- Link qualitative insights with quantitative data to enrich the understanding of the results.
## Step 4: Integrate feedback
- Integrate quantitative and qualitative analysis to create a comprehensive view of performance and competencies.
- Highlight areas of excellence and identify clear development opportunities.
## Step 5: Recommendations and Action Plan
- Based on the integrated analysis, formulate specific recommendations for each identified development area.
- Develop an action plan that includes specific goals, recommended development activities, and review dates.

## Integrated Multidimensional Feedback Analysis - answer:
### Quantitative Analysis of Teamwork
The average ratings across all feedback sources for the assessed competencies indicate the following:
- **Top 3 Competencies:**
  1. Demonstrating the intention to coordinate with other managers to achieve organizational goals (Average Rating: 4.71).
  2. Demonstrating humility and openness to learn from other managers (Average Rating: 4.71).
  3. Demonstrating the intention to support the decisions and actions of other managers (Average Rating: 4.71).
- **Bottom 3 Competencies:**
  1. Demonstrating the intention to give and receive feedback in an open and constructive manner (Average Rating: 4.14).
  2. Demonstrating the intention to understand and take into account the perspectives of other managers (Average Rating: 4.29).
  3. Sharing experiences and learnings with other managers (Average Rating: 4.43).
### Integrated Qualitative Analysis
- **Key Strengths:** The individual demonstrates strong capabilities in coordinating with others, showing humility, and supporting fellow managers, indicating effective teamwork and leadership qualities.
- **Opportunities for Development:** There's a need to enhance the frequency and quality of feedback exchange, and to better understand and consider others' perspectives. Improving in these areas could foster more collaborative and inclusive teamwork environments.
- **Differences in Perception:** The self-assessment ratings are generally lower than those provided by peers, suggesting a potential underestimation of one's own abilities in these areas or a more critical self-view. This discrepancy offers an opportunity for self-reflection and growth.
- **Implications:** Strengthening the identified opportunities for development can enhance interpersonal relationships, improve conflict resolution, and boost collective success in organizational goals.
### Recommendations for Action
1. **Leveraging Strengths:**
   - Continue to lead by example in coordination, humility, and supportiveness.
   - Mentor others in these areas to build a stronger, more cohesive team.
2. **Addressing Development Needs:**
   - Engage in training focused on effective feedback techniques to enhance communication skills.
   - Participate in workshops or activities aimed at empathy and perspective-taking to better understand and value diverse viewpoints.
   - Seek regular feedback on these areas of improvement to monitor progress.
3. **Resources and Support:**
   - Consider coaching sessions to refine feedback-giving and receiving skills.
   - Utilize organizational resources like peer learning groups to share and gain insights on effective teamwork strategies.
### Conclusion  
The evaluation of the manager's teamwork competencies reveals strong capabilities in coordinating with other managers, demonstrating humility, and providing support, which are critical for effective leadership and teamwork. These strengths indicate a solid foundation for fostering a positive and collaborative team environment.

However, there are opportunities for development, particularly in enhancing the quality and frequency of feedback exchange and in understanding and considering the perspectives of other managers more deeply. Addressing these areas could lead to more effective communication, improved conflict resolution, and a more inclusive and supportive team culture.

To capitalize on strengths and address development areas, targeted actions such as training in feedback techniques, engaging in empathy-building activities, and leveraging organizational resources for learning and growth are recommended. These steps can help the manager to further enhance their leadership effectiveness and contribute more significantly to the team and organizational success.
